# Golang Authentication Library using Gin, MongoDB, and JWT

This authentication system is built using the Go programming language, leveraging the Gin web framework for routing, MongoDB as the database for user storage, and JWT for secure token-based authentication

## Gin Framework:
Gin is employed to handle HTTP requests, providing a lightweight and flexible web framework for building RESTful APIs.

## MongoDB
MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database for storing user-related information, including usernames, securely hashed passwords, and other user details.

## JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for secure authentication. JWTs are generated upon user login, containing user information and signed to ensure integrity.

## User Authentication
- The system includes endpoints for user registration and login.
- Passwords are securely hashed and stored in MongoDB.
- JWT tokens are generated and returned to the user upon successful login


## Middleware for Authentication
- Middleware functions are implemented to validate JWT tokens for protected routes.
- Access to certain endpoints is restricted to authenticated users.

## Token Management
- Token refresh functionality is included to generate new JWT tokens with updated expiration times.
- A logout endpoint allows users to invalidate their JWT tokens.

This Golang authentication library provides a robust foundation for building secure and scalable web applications, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
